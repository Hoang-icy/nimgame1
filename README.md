# Simple Nim Game solved by Minimax algorithm
## Author: Dhruv Joshi

This is a very simple application of the minimax algorithm to play an adversarial zero-sum game against the computer. It is based on concepts learned when I took the class CS221 (Artificial Intelligence) taught by Prof. Percy Liang at Stanford.

## Objective of the game
The last player to move the "rock" into the end position wins the game. This can be modelled as a subtraction game - assume we start with a number 25 and either player can subtract 1,2 or 3. Turn by turn, each player chooses how much to subtract. The person to subtract the last number and reach 0 wins.
