# Simple Nim Game solved by Minimax algorithm
## Author: Dhruv Joshi

This is a very simple application of the minimax algorithm to play an adversarial zero-sum game against the computer. It is based on concepts learned when I took the class CS221 (Artificial Intelligence) taught by Prof. Percy Liang at Stanford.

## Objective of the game
